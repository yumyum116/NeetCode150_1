## Max Consecutive Ones - Design Notes

### Problem Summary
- Found a time consuming issue when compared with other approaches.

### Chosen Approach
- Linear Scan

### Why Linear Scan?
- The intensive and understandable approach for beginners.

### Strengths
- Fast enough $`O(n)`$ 

### Limitations
- Enlarge space complexity with large size of given list

### Alternatives Considered
- Brute-Force          : space complexity is $`O(1)`$, though time complexitiy is %`O(n^2)`$
- run-length tracking  : fast enough $`O(n)`$ and efficient space complexity $`O(1)`$
    
### Design Philosophy
- Chose the intensive approach
