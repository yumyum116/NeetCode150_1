## Two Sum - Design Notes

### Problem Summary
- Found a time consuming issue comparing with other approaches.

### Chosen Approach
- Brute-Force

### Why Brute-Force?
- The simplest and understandable approach for beginners.

### Strengths
- low extra memory : $`O(1)`$ 

### Limitations
- time consuming : $`O(n^2)`$

### Alternatives Considered
- Sorting             : relatively efficient in time complexitiy %`O(nlogn)`$, but has a space complexity $`O(n)`$
- Hash Map (Two Pass) : $`O(n)`$, the most efficient ways in time complexity, but has a space complexity $`O(n)`$
- Hash Map (One Pass) : $`O(n)`$, the most efficient ways in time complexity, but has a space complexity $`O(n)`$
    
### Design Philosophy
- Chose the simplest way
