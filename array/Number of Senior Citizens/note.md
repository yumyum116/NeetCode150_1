## Number of Senior Citizens - Design Notes

### Problem Summary
- Extra memory is used especially for non-used variables.

### Chosen Approach
- String Parsing

### Why String Parsing?
- Simple, intensive, and the fastest way.

### Strengths
- Intensive and understandable

### Limitations
- Valid when the structure of the string is given.

### Alternatives Considered
- Character-Based Extraction : time complexity is $`O(n)`$ and space complexity is $`O(1)`$
      
### Design Philosophy
- Chose the intensive approach
