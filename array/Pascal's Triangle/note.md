## Dynamic Programming - Design Notes

### Problem Summary
- Found a time consuming issue when constanct multiple
- Low stability due to edge handling and many append processes.

### Chosen Approach
- Dynamic Programming 

### Why Dynamic Programming?
- The intensive and understandable approach for beginners.

### Strengths
- Intensive and understandable
- low extra memory, only $`O(n^2)`$ memory needs

### Limitations
- time consuming when constant multiple
- low stability due to edge handling and append processes

### Alternatives Considered
- Combinatorics        : low space complexity $`O(1)`$, excluding memory for output amd high efficiency in time complexity especially when constant multiples, and high stability
- Dynamic Programming  : good approach when considering both optimazation and stability
    
### Design Philosophy
- Chose the intensive approach
